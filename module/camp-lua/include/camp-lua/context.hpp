 * \brief camp::lua::Context represents a self contained Lua virtual machine (a Lua state).
 *
 * camp::lua::Context is the entry point of the CAMP Lua module. It allows to execute arbitrary Lua
 * codes and scripts.
 * A camp::lua::Context can have a parent one (Lua thread is used internally). A hierarchy of
 * camp::lua::Context will share the same global variables but each context has its one execution
 * stack.
 *
 * Global variables are accessible through the [] operator:
 * \code
 * camp::lua::Context c;
 * c["a"] = 1;
 * c["b"] = c["a"];
 * \endcode
 *
 * Boolean, integer, real, string and userobject are handled. All properties and functions of a
 * userobject will be accessible from Lua.
 *
 * A top-level camp::lua::Context (i.e. with no parent context) being self contained, it allows to
 * run different ones in different system threads.
